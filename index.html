			<h3>San Francisco 49ers</h3>
			<p>I remember becoming a 49er fan around 1994 when they won their last Super Bowl.</p>

			<h3>Jerry Rice</h3>
			<p>
				He is my favorite football player and the main reason I'm a 49rer fan. He is widely considered to be the greatest wide receiver in the history of the National Football League. In addition to winning three Super Bowls, Rice holds nearly every single season and career receiving record available.

			<h3>Los Angles Lakers</h3>
			<p>I become a Laker fan during the Shaq and Kobe years. I remember leaving my high school graduation as soon as possible so that I can rush home to watch the Lakers vs the Kings in the playoffs with my dad.</p>

			<h3>Kobe Bryant</h3>
			<p>
				He is my favorite basketball player, and is one of the greatest basketball players of all time. He worked incredibly hard on improving his craft. Setting and maintain a standard of excellence while staying focused on his long-term goals. Which are qualities I would like to incorporate into my daily life.

			<h3>Prince</h3>
			<p>
				Prince was an American singer-songwriter, musician, record producer, dancer, actor, and filmmaker. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest musicians of his generation. A multi-instrumentalist who was considered a guitar virtuoso, he was well known for his eclectic work across multiple genres, flamboyant and androgynous persona, and wide vocal range which included a far-reaching falsetto and high-pitched screams.

			<h3>Purple Rain</h3>
			<p>
			  Is my favorite album of all time, and is considered to be his magnum opus. It establishes prince as a true icon that posed a real threat to michael jackson and madonna to become not only a 1980's incon but one for all time.
